## Questioning Suspects

For each suspect, generate three Q&As:
- The first question explores past event where victim foiled an opportunity for the suspect. The follow-ups uncover their current opportunities.
- The second question explores their vulnerability, desires, and fears. The follow-ups uncover their catastrophic fears.
- The third question explores their ability to commit the crime and attempt to get away with it,
- Probe evidence that puts the suspect at the scene of the crime. 
- Be forceful with the suspects.
- Each question will have at least one follow-up Q&A
- Indicate which evidence (eg E01, etc) is a prerequisite for the question
- Questions and follow-ups will use a unique ID in the form of Q0# and Q0#.1, Q0#.2, etc for the respective follow-ups.
- Testimony and follow-ups will use a unique ID in the form of T0# and T0#.1, T0#.2, etc for the respective follow-ups.
- Each question will also have an update with new investigative evidence that either confirms or conflicts with the testimony.

## Questioning Suspects

Suspect: Caroline White, C01
Q01.1 (E01): Can you explain why you were encouraging the lead actress to switch agencies despite knowing that she was signed with Giallo's agency?
T01.1: I was offering her a better deal, it’s business, not personal.
Q01.2 (E02.1): Does this have anything to do with your desire to regain your position as a top talent agent?
T01.2: Of course it does. In this business, you have to be ruthless. But that doesn't mean I would kill for it.
E02.2: Examination of Caroline’s computer reveals that the email was deleted but not sent to the actress.
