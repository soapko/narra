- {C01} ↔ {C03}: {description}
- {C02} ↔ {C04}: {description}
- …

~~~

---

### Example:
~~~
@include {core_incident_content}
@include {characters_content}

## Relationships and Dynamics:
- C01 ↔ C02: Mentor-protégé but growing resentment over uncredited work.
- C03 ↔ C04: Office gossip partners feeding each other rumors.
- C02 ↔ C04: Secret alliance to undermine C01’s project.

## Evaluation:
- Clarity and tension: Dynamics feel plausible and conflict-rich.
- Suggestion: Add a hidden familial tie to complicate loyalties.
