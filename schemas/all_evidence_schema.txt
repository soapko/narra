# Revised Evidence Compilation

Compile existing crime scene evidence and testimony into a single document.

Notes:
- Use capitalization instead of "**"
- Use sentence-case capitalization for all descriptions.
- Omit any suggestions, deductions, or editorialization from the evidence descriptions. Leave all deductions to the reader:
    + good: "The missing time coincides with the estimated time of the victim's death."
    + bad: "The missing time coincides with the estimated time of the victim's death, raising suspicions about their whereabouts. "
