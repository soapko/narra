# Act II - Evidence gathering

For each "Location of Interest", generate evidence:
- The scene of the crime will have three pieces of evidence and the other locations will have one or two.
- One piece of red-herring evidence should appear to reference multiple suspects.
- Show a suspect's desire, or reference an opportunity to attain it.
- Tie one or more suspects to the scene or method of the crime.
- Each evidence will have a follow-up that reveals an important insight which either incriminates or exonerates suspects.
- Do not speculate on who the evidence incriminates or exonerates.
- Do not speculate on what the evidence suggests.

## Act I - Gathering evidence

Location: {location_long_name}, {location_ID}
E01: {evidence_name}
{description}
E01.1 {new_insight}

Location: {location_long_name}, {location_ID}
E02: {evidence_name}

### Example:

~~~
## Act I - Gathering evidence

Location: Shark tank, L01
E01: Rare deep-sea species housed in the shark tank
These particular species are known for their lethality and rarity.
E01.1 These sharks have been illegally trafficked, despite what Clara said.
