## Getting Started
Every character in a murder mystery is driven by deep-seated motives, shaped by their past experiences, current desires, and the socio-economic environment. These elements combine to push them towards drastic actions under the right circumstances.

**General Guidelines:**
- Use inclusive and gender-neutral language.
- Avoid detective or police characters to focus on interpersonal dynamics.
- Develop four main characters, each with distinct but interconnected narratives.
