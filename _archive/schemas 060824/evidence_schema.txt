# Act II - Evidence gathering

For each "Location of Interest", generate evidence:
- The scene of the crime will have three pieces of evidence and the other locations will have one or two.
- One piece of red-herring evidence should appear to reference multiple suspects.
- Show a suspect's desire, or reference an opportunity to attain it.
- Tie one or more suspects to the scene or method of the crime.
- Each evidence will have a follow-up that reveals an important insight which either incriminates or exonerates suspects.
- Do not speculate on who the evidence incriminates or exonerates.
- Do not speculate on what the evidence suggests.

## Use this schema:

## Act II - Evidence gathering

Location: {location_label}
Evidence-1: {evidence_name}
Description-1: {description}
Follow-up-1.1: {new_insight}

Evidence-2 {evidence_name}
Description-2: {description}
Follow-up-2.1: {new_insight}

Evidence-3 {evidence_name}
Description-3: {description}
Follow-up-3.1: {new_insight}

Evidence: RARE DEEP-SEA SPECIES HOUSED IN THE SHARK TANK
Description: THESE PARTICULAR SPECIES ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR LETHALITY AND RARITY.
Follow-up: THESE SHARKS HAVE BEEN ILLEGALLY TRAFFICKED, DESPITE WHAT CLARA SAID WHICH SUGGESTS SHE MAY BE HOLDING SOMETHING BACK.
