# Generate the crime

There needs to be a red-herring and twist in the details surrounding the murder similar to these:
- The victim appears to have been crushed by falling rocks, but they had poison in their system, not trauma from being crushed.
- The victim was found dead in a suspect's lab with poisonous plants, but evidence suggests the body had been strangled and moved.
- The victim was found dead in the desert in apparent skydiving accident, but they appear to have been mortally irradiated beforehand.

The crime will almost never be a poisoning.

The crime scene report:
- Is an initial impression that will focus only on what is readily seen, heard, or smelled. 
- It will not contain details that require additional lab work or analysis such as fingerprints, forensics, DNA. 
- It will contain a surprising and important detail

An initial autopsy report:
- Is the first analysis by a coroner or field expert and can discern trauma or irregularities in the interior and exterior of the victim's body.
- It will not contain details that require additional lab work such as blood work, forensics, DNA
- It can introduce a new surprising cause-of-death, however, that contradicts the initial crime scene impression

The follow-up report:
- Is the final illuminating report from toxicology, ballistics, forensics, DNA
- It will reveal or confirm a key incriminating detail
