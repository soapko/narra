# Act III : The Crime - The reveal
Write a paragraph which describes the crime:
The perpetrator is revealed:
- Is rarely the obvious suspect
- A twist reveals that early evidence is a red-herring, or mis-interpreted to implicate someone else

Examples:
- Although BOB regularly threatened to kill the victim, it was the victim's own wife who did it. Because she was tired of his physical abuse and she framed BOB for it.
- Although the victim died from poison and JILL is a chemist who works with poisons, JANE poisoned the victim knowing it would make JILL look like the killer
