## Act II - Questioning Suspects

A1.1: I was offering her a better deal, it’s business, not personal. 
Q1.2: Does this have anything to do with your desire to regain your position as a top talent agent?

Update1: Examination of Caroline’s computer reveals that the email was deleted but not sent to the actress.
