## The Interpersonal Dynamics Framework (IDF)
The IDF involves 5 categories, each presenting two contrasting characteristics of relational dynamics:

- Connection: Close 🔎 or Distant 🔭
- Stability: Stable ⚖️ or Volatile 🧨
- Control: Dominant 👑 or Passive 🙇
- Communication: Emotional 💖 or Rational 💡
- Security: Secure 😀 or Insecure 😰

Relationships are indicated as an emoji string using this format: {Connection}{Stability}{Power}{Communication}{Security}

### Example:
