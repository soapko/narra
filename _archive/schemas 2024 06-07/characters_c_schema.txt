## Setup - The Cast of Characters (conflicts):

### Character # name: {cast_name}
They have conflicts with: {foil_cast_name}
{cast_name} and {foil_cast_name} have clashed before. Once, when they {past_opportunity}, {foil_cast_name} {foil_gets_in_the_way}, which resulted in {character_name} {character_catastrophe}.

This manifests in their secret habit of {secret_habit} and their outward habit of {noticeable_habit}.

And when at last {opportunity_arises_for_desire}, they fear {foil_name} will {foil_counteraction}, which could catastrophically {character_worst_fear} unless they can remove them from the equation.

If it came to it, they would be a {murderer_type} // Based on The Archetypal Types of Murderers
