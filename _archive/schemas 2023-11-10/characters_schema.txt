Murder is the result of a person being driven beyond the extremes of what a person can tolerate. They don't see any other way out or to get what they desperately need. It requires past events so traumatic, or a future so bleak that they believe murder is the only option left to them.

### Example:

~~~
## Setup - The Five Characters:

Character 1 name: TAYLOR HAWKINS
Their role/occupation is: ROBOTICS ENGINEER
Their age: 45
They were born to this class: LOWER CLASS
If different, they are currently in this class: LOWER MIDDLE CLASS
People think they are this type of person: OUTGOING SOCIALITE
If different, they are actually this type of person: RECLUSIVE INTROVERT
Their influence comes from their: EXPERTISE IN THE DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE OF SPACE-RELATED MACHINERY AND ROBOTICS 
Their greatest vulnerability is their: NEED TO TAKE ANTI-PSYCHOTIC MEDICATION
Their driving emotion is: FEAR
Their characteristic manner of speaking: EFFUSIVE
They have conflicts with this character: DR. MASON
Their relationship with DR. MASON is: ðŸ”ŽðŸ§¨ðŸ‘‘ðŸ’¡ðŸ˜€

TAYLOR HAWKINS has a traumatic past of WORKING ON A MISSION WHERE A FELLOW ASTRONAUT DIED DUE TO TECHNICAL FAILURE that manifests today as SECURITY CATASTROPHIZING. As a result, they desperately need TO PROVE THAT DR. MASON'S RESEARCH IS DANGEROUS, but DR. MASON'S REPUTATION AND CONTROL OVER THE MISSION always gets in the way.

TAYLOR and DR. MASON have clashed before. Once, when they WERE GIVEN AUTHORITY TO IMPLEMENT NEW SECURITY PROCEDURES, DR. MASON CALLED IN A FAVOR TO BE MADE EXEMPT FROM THE SECURITY MEASURES, which resulted in TAYLOR BEING UNABLE TO STOP ANOTHER ACCIDENT.

This manifests in their secret habit of OBSESSIVELY WATCHING SECURITY FOOTAGE and their outward habit of REFLEXIVELY QUESTIONING THE SAFETY OF EVERYTHING DR. MASON SUGGESTS.

And when at last THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPOSE DR. MASON'S DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR arises, they fear DR. MASON will GET THEM FIRED instead, which could catastrophically END THEIR CAREER IN SPACE EXPLORATION unless they can remove them from the equation.

Character 2 name: ANGIE BROCKMAN
