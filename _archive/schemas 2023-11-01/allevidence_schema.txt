### Example:

In the file 'evidence_content.json':
~~~
### Location: STAIRCASE
Evidence-1: SMALL BLOOD SMEAR
Description-1: Found on the uppermost rung of the staircase. Matches type with the victim's blood.
Follow-up-1.1: Additionally, traces of skin tissue under the victim’s fingernails suggests the victim struggled with their assailant at this position.

Evidence-2: CRACK ON TILE
Description-2: A tile from the top rung of the staircase bears a significant crack, potentially from a sharp, forceful impact.
Follow-up-2.1: The crack matches the size of the digging tools found in the Garden, hinting at how the cause of the fall might have been orchestrated.

Evidence-3: LOOSE AREA RUG
Description-3: Positioned precariously on the top rung of the staircase. It appears to have been recently disturbed.
Follow-up-3.1: A few strands of hair found intertwined with the rug fibers match Celeste's hair, placing her on the scene.

~~~
Location: STAIRCASE
Evidence-1: SMALL BLOOD SMEAR
Follow-up-1.2: A new DNA-test reveals not only the DNA of ALEXI KRAMER in the blood smear, but also a few strands of DNA that match with CELESTE GREY.

Evidence-3: LOOSE AREA RUG
Follow-up-3.2: Further examination of the rug revealed an additional crucial clue - the imprint of an unusually designed sole consistent with the shoes which only CELESTE GREY wears.
